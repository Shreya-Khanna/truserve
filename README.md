## Usage

We made this app to create a mediator between organisations with surplus food and those that do not have consistent access to food and would appreciate the surplus.

The business model we had in mind was a premium subscription, that offered delivery services, 24/7 customer support, and live notifications for food updates. We see the potential of the app being used by firms and MNCs as a way to fulfill Corporate Social Responsibility as well.
